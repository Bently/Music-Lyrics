[Verse]
Jenny Jenny, who can I turn to?
You give me something I can hold onto
I know you think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

[Chorus]
Jenny I got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number

867-5309
(867-5309)
867-5309
(867-5309)

[Verse]
Jenny Jenny, your the girl for me
You don't know me but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before but I lost my nerve
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

[Chorus]
Jenny I got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number

867-5309
(867-5309)
867-5309
(867-5309)


[Bridge]

I got it (I got it)  I got it
I got you number on the wall
I got it (I got it)  I got it
For a good time, for a good time call!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Jenny I got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number
